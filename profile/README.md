# Echo Labs Development
## What do we do
Here at Echo Labs Development we are reamagining what factory automation and additive manufacturing can look like. We are making strides in user acessabiltiy and ease of use. We think that anyone would should be able to setup an automation cell.

## Who are we

### Henry Veedahl
Founder/CEO/Lead Enginer

### Eliot Gage
Lead Developer

## Our Projects
### Quantum Printer
An open source tool changer printer built to scale to factory levels

### Momentum Arm
An open source 6 axis robotics arm that can intergrate with other devieces to make automated cells.

## Why are we doing this
Tools like toolchanger 3d printers and robotic arms cost thousands of dollars and require operators with lots of expertise. We have dreamed about some day being to aford such tools as hobbyists. So we desided to take matters into our own hands and make the future we want.
